      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever hit a brick wall in your research on your family history? Wouldn’t you love it if all the information was in one spot? A One-Name Study is your answer. I am a Genealogist, and I want to make a website studying all the occurrences of the surname ‘Bigney’. At times the surnames in records are misspelled or were misheard, which make records hard to search for. I plan to look for these spelling variations and catalog them in one place. This website can become a great resource for those who are stuck and can’t find the next record for their research.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Genealogists researching Bigney families and people with Bigney heritage with all its spelling variations is the audience for this website. It is a very limited scope for an audience. There are many countries where people with Bigney heritage came from, including the United States, Canada, England, France, Australia, and Wales and we will target descendants of Bigney families. We will market to the serious researcher as well as those who are novice in their family history.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        BIGUENET, Beguenet: a name pertaining in the 17th century to Blamont, and long settled there. In 1636 we find a family of Biguenet there; in 1655 we note Isaac Beguenet among the townsmen of Blamont. Does the name originate from bégue (stammer) or from beguin (darling, hood, child’s cap) in its various spellings?

        A One-Name Study (ONS) is a project researching all occurrences of a surname, as opposed to a particular pedigree (ancestors of one person) or descendancy (descendants of one person or couple). 
      </p>
      <p>
The objective of a one-name study is not just the collection of data; collection is a means to an end. A one-name study aims to research the genealogy and family history of all persons with a given surname (and its variants). As part of this, it attempts to ascertain such things as –
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The origin of the name or early references</li>
        <li>The name’s meaning: is it patronymic, topographical, toponymic, occupational, etc.? Or a mix of these?</li>
        <li>Relative frequency</li>
        <li>Distribution in geography and time</li>
        <li>Patterns of immigration and emigration</li>
        <li>Name variants and “deviants” </li>
